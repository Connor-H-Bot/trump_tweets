# Donald Trump Tweet Archive
This repository contains a hand picked archive of tweets from U.S. President Donald Trump, collected to use within the trumptweetguesser.com game. 

This web app has no political ties or agenda, and serves to simply outline how outrageous/funny/crazy some of Donald's tweets have been. 

Thanks to resources like The Trump Archive and the community of developers and archivists, archives of Donald's tweets have made development of our tweet guesser game possible.
